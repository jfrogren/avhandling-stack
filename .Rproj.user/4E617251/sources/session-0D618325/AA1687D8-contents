Welcome to the \emph{R Markdown} thesis template. This template is based on (and in many places copied directly from) the Reed College LaTeX template, but hopefully it will provide a nicer interface for those that have never used TeX or LaTeX before. Using \emph{R Markdown} will also allow you to easily keep track of your analyses in \textbf{R} chunks of code, with the resulting plots and output included as well. The hope is this \emph{R Markdown} template gets you in the habit of doing reproducible research, which benefits you long-term as a researcher, but also will greatly help anyone that is trying to reproduce or build onto your results down the road.

Hopefully, you won't have much of a learning period to go through and you will reap the benefits of a nicely formatted thesis. The use of LaTeX in combination with \emph{Markdown} is more consistent than the output of a word processor, much less prone to corruption or crashing, and the resulting file is smaller than a Word file. While you may have never had problems using Word in the past, your thesis is likely going to be about twice as large and complex as anything you've written before, taxing Word's capabilities. After working with \emph{Markdown} and \textbf{R} together for a few weeks, we are confident this will be your reporting style of choice going forward.

\textbf{Why use it?}

\emph{R Markdown} creates a simple and straightforward way to interface with the beauty of LaTeX. Packages have been written in \textbf{R} to work directly with LaTeX to produce nicely formatting tables and paragraphs. In addition to creating a user friendly interface to LaTeX, \emph{R Markdown} also allows you to read in your data, to analyze it and to visualize it using \textbf{R} functions, and also to provide the documentation and commentary on the results of your project. Further, it allows for \textbf{R} results to be passed inline to the commentary of your results. You'll see more on this later.

\textbf{Who should use it?}

Anyone who needs to use data analysis, math, tables, a lot of figures, complex cross-references, or who just cares about the final appearance of their document should use \emph{R Markdown}. Of particular use should be anyone in the sciences, but the user-friendly nature of \emph{Markdown} and its ability to keep track of and easily include figures, automatically generate a table of contents, index, references, table of figures, etc. should make it of great benefit to nearly anyone writing a thesis project.

\chapter{Research projects linked to the studies}\label{research-projects-linked-to-the-studies}}

The four studies stemmed from four different research projects that all involved or targeted users in different ways:

SMART4MD (Support Monitoring and Reminder Technology for Mild Dementia) - a four year project co-financed by the European Union under the EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation -- Horizon 2020, with grant agreement number 643399, which aims to improve the quality of life of older people with cognitive decline or mild dementia and their carers, increase treatment compliance, reduce dementia-related costs by helping reduce the number of missed appointments and of hospital re-admissions and help reduce functional decline.

The Panel Study, an empirical project of the UserAge program that aims to determine the awareness and understanding of and attitudes toward user involvement in research among different categories of knowledge users and researchers over time.

The Housing Experiment (HX) was a large-scale CS initiative with housing accessibility as the topic in which older adults and people with disabilities were the main target groups. HX was implemented in collaboration between Public \& Science and researchers at the Centre for Ageing and Support Environments (CASE) at Lund University, involving the three largest Swedish senior citizens' associations (approximately 695,000 members in total) as partners as well as the software company MiThings. The aim of the HX was to engage people across Sweden to assess environmental barriers in the ordinary housing stock, using a mobile app developed for this purpose (Granbom, Slaug, BronÃ©us, Bergman \& Iwarsson, submitted to Citizen Science: Theory and Practice). The mobile app was based on Housing Enabler, which is an instrument for valid and reliable assessment of housing accessibility (Iwarsson et al., 2012).

The project Decision Support System for Improved Accessibility in Multi-Family Housing with the overarching aim to develop, test, and evaluate a new decision support system for improved accessibility in multi-family housing, and to contribute to efficient collaboration among professionals involved in health care, planning, and housing provision, as well as citizens. The project team of this project consisted of researchers and two non-academic partners: a public housing company and a micro-sized software development company.

The overarching aim of this thesis was to extend and deepen the current knowledge of user involvement in research on ageing and health, where users refers to representatives of older adults as well as other societal groups and actors with a direct or indirect interest in the research being conducted. Moreover to contribute strategies for involving users in future research on ageing and health.

Here I will describe how an ethical recommendation is made that people outside of the individual researchers are involved in the research process because it is a strength for relevance and transparency.

The four studies that make up this thesis contributed to the overarching aim which was to extend and deepen the current knowledge of user involvement in research on ageing and health, where users refer to representatives of older adults as well as other societal groups and actors with a direct or indirect interest in the research being conducted. The main result emerging from the four studies is that user involvement has a clear potential to broaden researchers' understanding of the complexity of a societal problem, but that a lack of certain central actors or groups risks creating an incomplete or downright distorted picture of the reality that researchers strive to understand, explain and improve.

Here I might have a figure to illustrate the result

\hypertarget{study-i}{%
\section{Study I}\label{study-i}}

The results from Study I will be summarized in one paragraph.
* Overall positive attitude towards the app that was developed based on the evaluation that was made.
* Standard measures of usability (SUS) not reliable to use on a target goup with cognitive decline - confusing.
* That older people form a heterogeneous group with varied knowledge about and familiarity with mobile digital technology. Thus while a few individuals with less cognitive impairment and a greater awareness and knowledge of what is possible to achieve with technology today, might find the app very limited and not useful. While on the other hand individuals 90+ might find the technology challenging due to their overall bodily function such as swollen fingers, and thus really need to see a clear purpose with this technology in order to find it worthy to spend valuable time exploring and learning it.
* Moreover, that less exposure to similar technology will likely effect both ability and self-esteem and thus need to be taken into consideration when introducing an app.
* That it can be parts that make up entertainment (cognitive games) that can prove to be the most appreciated of all the parts in a content, even if these do not constitute what, based on the plan, is intended as the central content.
* As to the app development that more ``common ground'' between developers of technology and end users would make the process easier and would require less iterations.

\hypertarget{study-ii}{%
\section{Study II}\label{study-ii}}

The results from Study II will be summarized in one paragraph.
* Engaging older people in Sweden in research targeting active involvement in research presents a challenge.
* The study shows an over-representation of people with higher education, who tend to be more aware, have previous experience, and are more willing to be involved in research with public involvement.
* This implies a risk that groups with lower education are not represented, and that knowledge co-produced with mostly highly educated groups will lead to a biased picture. Further studies are needed to understand how an increased awareness of research and willingness to participate can be achieved.

\hypertarget{study-iii}{%
\section{Study III}\label{study-iii}}

The results from Study III will be summarized in one paragraph.
* In response to the lack of systematic analyses of CS initiatives from the participants' perspective, this study contributes with knowledge about participant characteristics and attitudinal changes in a Swedish CS initiative on housing accessibility with older adults and people with disabilities as the main target group.
* The low response and completion rates reinforce the picture from earlier studies that it is challenging to get older adults in Sweden to participate in research about research. This is especially true for people with a lower level of education.
* The fact that mobile digital literacy and functional ability were factors characterizing the full participants in the study strengthens the image from previous studies that limitations in these areas affect the interest in or ability to get involved in research.
* The only attitudinal change shown, in the reversed direction of what could be anticipated regarding housing accessibility, should be seen in the light of the predominantly positive attitudes prior to the HX.
* Further research is warranted to investigate how CS initiatives targeting older adults and people with disabilities could be designed, prepared and executed to elicit more commitment and interest in research and the research topic at stake.

\hypertarget{study-iv}{%
\section{Study IV}\label{study-iv}}

The results from Study IV will be summarized in one paragraph.
* While discussions regarding the provision of accessible housing for the ageing population among researchers and representatives of housing sector and public institutions are dominated by socioeconomic matters, the multiple dimensions of this wicked problem are intertwined in a complex manner.
* This is critical for decision-making, which, to a large extent, takes place in parallel organizations and processes with insufficient communication among the actors involved, which speaks to the need for boundary work.
* Decision-making linked to housing accessibility should not be approached solely considering biophysical or financial variables. Rather, issues related to ethics, aesthetics, and empathy variables that are interrelated should not be ignored.
* The framework used in this study can serve as a cognitive tool for decision-makers, and the findings could increase the awareness of the diversity of individual thinking involved when addressing this wicked problem.
* Acting upon the critical variables identified in this study could contribute to progressive decision-making and more efficient ways to develop and provide accessible housing for the ageing population.

\hypertarget{limitations}{%
\subsection{Limitations}\label{limitations}}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Since the key actors were highly selected, a limitation could be that they may not represent those that potentially could benefit from new knowledge produced.
\item
  In addition to the fact that the number of participants was low, a noteworthy shortcoming is that we failed to include key actors from the private housing sector, as those invited were not able or willing to participate. Their absence was raised as an issue by key actors from public housing companies with the argument that they are both players in the same market.

\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Ãldre mÃ¤nniskor en heterogen grupp med varierade kunskaper och fÃ¶rmÃ¥gor, t.ex i fÃ¶rhÃ¥llande till mobil digital teknik. Med andra ord med skiftande behov och perspektiv som utifrÃ¥n en demokratisk aspekt Ã¤r viktiga att ta i beaktning nÃ¤r syftet som forskare Ã¤r att fÃ¶rklara, fÃ¶rstÃ¥ och fÃ¶rbÃ¤ttra vÃ¤rlden
\item
  SamhÃ¤lleliga problem sÃ¥som the provision of housing accessibility Ã¤r wicked som Ã¤r svÃ¥ra att ringa in och hitta en lÃ¶sning pÃ¥ som alla eller en majoritet av samhÃ¤llets aktÃ¶rer och representanter Ã¤r nÃ¶jda med.
\item
  MEN user involvement in research on ageing and health kan utgÃ¶ra just ett sÃ¤tt att gÃ¶ra komplexiteten begriplig och att fÃ¥nga in flera dimensioner av problemet.
\item
  Dock utgÃ¶r det en begrÃ¤nsning om vissa key actors are not able or willing to participate, vilket i wicked-problem fallet var fallet med privata aktÃ¶rer. Det riskerar att ett potentiellt centralt perspektiv i en komplex frÃ¥ga faller bort.
\item
  Eftersom forskning om Ã¥ldrande och hÃ¤lsa utgÃ¶r just Ã¤ldre personer en expertgrup (de Ã¤r expert pÃ¥ sitt eget Ã¥ldrande) och Ã¤ldre Ã¤r en heterogen grupp Ã¤r denna grupp central nÃ¤r det kommer till user involvement in research on ageing and health. Men flera av studierna i denna avhandling indikerar att vissa kategorier/subgrupper av Ã¤ldre personer are less willing or able to get actively involved. One limitation is thus that det som framkommer inte utgÃ¶r en representativ bild av den verklighet i form av de problem och utmaningar som den Ã¤ldre befolkningen i Sveige mÃ¶ter.
  Denna skevhet eller begrÃ¤nsade representativitet har visserligen indikerats i andra studier men inte pÃ¥ samma systematiska sÃ¤tt som hÃ¤r (tÃ¤nker pÃ¥ panelstudien).
\end{itemize}
Strategier framÃ¥t (= rekommendationer fÃ¶r framtida forskare inom fÃ¤ltet) kan utgÃ¶ras av att:
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  AnvÃ¤nda dimensionsmodellen (i wicked problemartikeln) som en utgÃ¥ngspunkt fÃ¶r att sÃ¤kerstÃ¤lla att ett komplext problem inte lyfts fram alltfÃ¶r ensidigt utan att flera perspektiv kommer fram
\item
  Vid anvÃ¤ndandet av digital teknik i anslutning till user involvement beakta Ã¤ldres heterogenitet och fÃ¶rsÃ¶k att hitta strategier fÃ¶r att den avsedda mÃ¥lgruppen kan ta den i bruk, och om deltagarna inte Ã¤r representativa fÃ¶r den Ã¤ldre gruppen i stort sÃ¥ var tydlig med att lyfta fram det som en begrÃ¤nsning i studien.
\end{itemize}
\hypertarget{further-research-and-development}{%
\subsection{Further research and development}\label{further-research-and-development}}

BehÃ¶vs ytterligare forskning fÃ¶r att undersÃ¶ka hur dessa fÃ¶reslagna strategier kan vara behjÃ¤lpliga i att i hÃ¶gre utstÃ¤ckning skapa fÃ¶rutsÃ¤ttningar fÃ¶r att Ã¤ven grupper som idag inte vill eller anser sig ha fÃ¶rmÃ¥gan att delta i forskning om Ã¥ldrande och hÃ¤lsa.
